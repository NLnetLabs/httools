# Tools for Building an HTTP Service with Hyper

In many cases, when building a web service, you donâ€™t want to use a
framework either because it feels like overkill or none of them quite
fits with what you are doing. Plain [hyper](https://hyper.rs/) is a
perfectly fine choice, but you might find yourself implementing the same
quality-of-life features over and over again.

This crate is a collection of these little things that make it easier and
more convenient to implement a web service directly atop hyper.
